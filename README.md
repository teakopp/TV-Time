### Still a work in progress...

At the moment comes pre-packaged with all sorts of high quality gifs.
Good for the office, family functions, or avoiding looking at nature at all costs while camping.

### To make this thing work
1. Install npm dependencies (cd into directory then `npm install`)
1. Drag any Gifs or images into the gifs folder (Feel free to delete exisiting ones) 
2. Start it up (`npm start`)

### Controls
`Left Arrow` moves backwards through gif queue
`Right Arrow` moves forwards through gif queue
`Spacebar` gives you random pick
