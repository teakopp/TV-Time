# TV-Time
An electron app for watching gifs or other animated images, fullscreen 

Still a work in progress...

At the moment comes pre-packaged with all sorts of dope gifs.
Good for the office, family functions, or avoiding looking at nature at all costs while camping.

### To make this thing work
1. Install npm dependencies (cd into directory then `npm install`)
1. Drag any Gifs or images into the gifs folder (Feel free to delete exisiting ones) 
2. Start it up (`npm start`)
